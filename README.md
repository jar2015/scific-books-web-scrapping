# PRAC 1: Web Scrapping

# Autor
Jose Antonio Rodriguez Guzman

# Description
During the course "Typology and life cycle of data" of the Master in Data Science at the UOC, we were asked to select a web page and apply web scrapping techniques to it using tools such as Python or R and thus generate a dataset.

To do this, I chose a book website called BookRix and the sub-category science fiction, due to personal interest in these types of books.  

# Files
- (src/books_full_dataset.py) : it contains the python code where the BookRix site is web scraped to extract data related to the name of the book, the author, language, number of visits, times the book has been marked as a favorite; to finally create a csv file.
